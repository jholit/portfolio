Personal Portfolio – Jaqweal Holit

Product Designer • UX Systems • Flow-First Thinking

This repository contains the source code for my personal product design portfolio — a hand-crafted, static site built to demonstrate clarity, systems thinking, and a flow-driven approach to UX.

The site's design choices reflect how I approach product design:
structured, intentional, minimal, and guided by how people actually move through a flow.

🔧 Tech Stack

HTML5

CSS3 (fully custom, no frameworks)

Vanilla JavaScript (for year auto-update only)

GitHub Pages (hosting)

The site intentionally avoids frameworks to keep things lightweight, readable, and fast — showing comfort with structure, layout, and semantic clarity.

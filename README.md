# Personal Portfolio – Jaqweal Holit  
Product Designer • UX Systems • Flow-First Thinking

This repository contains the source code for my personal product design portfolio.  
The website is built as a lightweight, fully hand-coded static site with a focus on:

- clear information hierarchy  
- thoughtful flow-first UX writing  
- clean, consistent visual structure  
- fast load times and no external dependencies  

---

## 🔧 Tech Stack  
- **HTML5**  
- **CSS3** (custom, no frameworks)  
- **Vanilla JS** (minimal; year auto-update only)  
- **GitHub Pages** for hosting  

The goal of this site is to keep the surface simple while demonstrating  
intentional structure, rhythm, and clarity—much like my design approach.

## 🪄 AI-Assisted Crafting  
Parts of the site—especially spacing passes, microcopy tuning,  
and semantic refinements—were created with **AI-assisted collaboration**  
to speed up polishing and iteration.  
All structure, intent, content direction, and design decisions remain my own.

# 🌐 Jaqweal Holit | Portfolio Website

Welcome to my personal portfolio — a growing collection of design, development, and writing projects that reflect my ongoing journey from **UI/UX Designer** to **Front-End Developer**, and beyond into **Full-Stack Product Engineering**.

This website serves as both a showcase of my work and a narrative of progress — balancing visual storytelling, simplicity, and human-centered design.

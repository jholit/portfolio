     01 — PROJECT SNAPSHOT
============================================================ -->
<section class="project-section" id="snapshot">
  <div class="wide-shell"><div class="text-col">

    <h2 class="section-title"><span class="section-index">01</span>Project Snapshot</h2>

    <p>
      Quillty was born out of a frustrating but inspired night of bouncing between different writing applications that couldn’t synchronize, couldn’t unify their purpose, and couldn’t support the way writers actually think. Modern writing tools have become bloated, monetized, and detached from the human-centered foundation of writing itself. Writing is a civilizational skill—so why should we have to pay subscription fees just to express ideas?
    </p>

    <p>
      Quillty challenges that by combining the broadest purpose of writing with a unified, distraction-free environment. It helps people write professionally or creatively without feeling like the software is doing the work for them—jumpstarting flow while keeping the writer in control.
    </p>

    <p>
      The vision is simple: bring writing into the digital age by removing bloat, rebuilding the experience from the ground up, and creating a modern, minimal, visually appealing environment that still feels powerful.
    </p>

     02 — MY ROLE & CONSTRAINTS
============================================================ -->
<section class="project-section" id="role">
  <div class="wide-shell"><div class="text-col">

    <h2 class="section-title"><span class="section-index">02</span>My Role & Constraints</h2>

    <p>
      My role in Quillty wasn’t just to design a UI—it was to think like a writer. Too many tools are built from a top-down perspective, shaped by corporate priorities rather than the needs of real people. Writing is bottom-up by nature: anyone can place words on a page, but not every environment supports the writer’s focus, clarity, or flow.
    </p>

    <p>
      Every decision I made for Quillty centered on this question: “Can the environment help the writer do what they do best?” This meant building with a writer’s mindset, shaping space, silence, and focus instead of adding friction or noise.
    </p>

    <p>
      The first version of Quillty is intentionally mid-fidelity. It explores how a modern alternative to traditional word processors could look and feel—without diving into full prototyping yet. Many people rightfully complain that Word, Google Docs, and similar tools still lack intuitive features that should exist by default.
    </p>

    <p>
      This version isn’t meant to be final. It is a foundation for future prototypes as my technical experience grows and demonstrates that visually compelling interfaces can still be rooted in strong product reasoning.
    </p>

     03 — DESIGN PHILOSOPHY & UI STRUCTURE
============================================================ -->
<section class="project-section" id="design-philosophy">
  <div class="wide-shell"><div class="text-col">

    <h2 class="section-title"><span class="section-index">03</span>Design Philosophy & UI Structure</h2>

    <p>
      My design philosophy didn’t begin with Quillty—Quillty simply became the moment where it all clicked. Many designers start by polishing surfaces without addressing foundational UX issues first. My process works differently: I zero in on the most frustrating or structurally important problems early, because solving those unlocks the rest of the product’s clarity.
    </p>

    <p>
      The principle is simple: fix the hardest problems first. Once those decisions are made, everything from user flows to prototypes becomes easier and more coherent. Quillty embodies that idea by stripping real-world tools down to their most essential purpose and rebuilding them in a clearer, more organized way.
    </p>

    <p>
      Quillty’s interface takes influence from Microsoft Word, Google Drive, Adobe Reader, and Framer—each offering a lesson in what to keep and what to avoid. Word is powerful but visually overwhelming. Google Drive is functional but limited as a writing environment. Adobe Reader’s structured navigation inspired document mapping, and Framer’s restraint informed the styling experience.
    </p>

    <p>
      Everything in Quillty is collapsible, quiet, and built around reducing cognitive load. The central writing area remains sacred, untouched by clutter. The left panel anchors structure; the right panel handles styling. Nothing overlaps, nothing distracts, and nothing gets in the writer’s way.
    </p>

     04 — NAVIGATION BAR OVERVIEW
============================================================ -->
<section class="project-section" id="navigation-bar">
  <div class="wide-shell"><div class="text-col">

    <h2 class="section-title"><span class="section-index">04</span>Navigation Bar Overview</h2>

    <p>
      The navigation bar provides Quillty’s top-level structure: workspace controls, document identity, and essential actions. It stays intentionally quiet to avoid pulling attention from the writing environment. Its eventual evolution will support quick actions and deeper customization, allowing writers to tailor their workspace without unnecessary clutter.
    </p>

     05 — SIDE PANELS OVERVIEW
============================================================ -->
<section class="project-section" id="side-panels">
  <div class="wide-shell"><div class="text-col">

    <h2 class="section-title"><span class="section-index">05</span>Side Panels Overview</h2>

    <p>
      Quillty features two primary side panels: the Mapping Panel on the left, and the Styles Panel on the right. Together, they create a structured, distraction-minimized environment that supports both navigation and editing without overwhelming the user.
    </p>

  </div></div>

  <!-- =======================
       05A — MAPPING PANEL
  ========================== -->
  <div class="wide-shell"><div class="text-col">

    <h3 class="section-title"><span class="section-index">05A</span>Mapping Panel (Left Side)</h3>

    <p>
      The Mapping Panel organizes long-form documents into a clear hierarchy. It allows writers to navigate chapters, sections, and subsections without losing their place or breaking their flow. This part of the project will be expanded further as the design evolves.
    </p>

  </div></div>

  <!-- =======================
       05B — STYLES PANEL
  ========================== -->
  <div class="wide-shell"><div class="text-col">

    <h3 class="section-title"><span class="section-index">05B</span>Styles Panel (Right Side)</h3>

    <!-- (Your full polished text here) -->

    <p>
      The Styles Panel is dedicated entirely to text, media, and document-level editing. Its purpose is to provide a clean, minimal, and distraction-free alternative to the cluttered menus found in Microsoft Word—centralizing only the most essential formatting tools in a modern, Framer-inspired layout.
    </p>

    <p>
      One of the most important design decisions involved the content upload button. In the earliest version, it lived at the very bottom of the Styles Panel, beneath all editing properties. This created friction: as more styling tools were added, users would need to scroll constantly just to reach the uploader—unless a search bar was introduced, which would complicate the UI and violate the panel’s minimalist purpose. To resolve this, the uploader was moved out of the panel and placed into its own small, dedicated section directly beneath it. This keeps the panel focused, predictable, and avoids unnecessary scrolling. The uploader still collapses like all other panels, preserving Quillty’s writing-first philosophy.
    </p>

    <p>
      Editing tools are a blend of keyboard-driven inputs and dropdowns. This avoids the visual chaos that would come from typing out styling attributes directly. For example, when selecting text decorations, the transformation controls temporarily shift downward to make room for the options. After a selection is made, the layout returns to normal, keeping everything clean and intuitive.
    </p>

    <p>
      Additional styling controls will be introduced later, so the Styles Panel includes a scrollable region. Scrolling is one of the simplest, least intrusive gestures, making it ideal for vertically stacked tool collections. The scrollbar only appears on hover—mirroring the Mapping Panel—to reduce visual noise.
    </p>

    <p>
      Ultimately, the Styles Panel gives writers the right amount of power at the right moment without interrupting the writing experience.
    </p>

     06 — EVOLVING FEATURE DIRECTION
============================================================ -->
<section class="project-section" id="feature-direction">
  <div class="wide-shell"><div class="text-col">

    <h2 class="section-title"><span class="section-index">06</span>Evolving Feature Direction</h2>

    <p>
      At this stage, Quillty focuses primarily on the writing experience. Future updates will expand into note-taking capabilities, enhanced writing support systems, real-time synchronization, file management, and a styling experience that stays lightweight while still feeling powerful.
    </p>

    <p>
      The guiding principle is simple: sacrifices should never be mistaken for balance. Balance means maintaining consistency—and UI/UX is no exception. Adding features simply because they seem exciting must always be measured against whether they genuinely serve the user. Quillty’s direction remains rooted in restraint and clarity, providing writers with what truly matters.

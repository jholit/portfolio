                Quillty is a product design exploration focused on creating a modern,
                human-centered writing environment that prioritizes clarity, restraint,
                and writer flow over feature bloat.

              <h2 class="section-title">Why Quillty Exists</h2>

              <p>
                Quillty was born out of a frustrating but inspired night of bouncing
                between writing tools that failed to synchronize, unified neither
                purpose nor workflow, and ultimately distracted from the act of writing
                itself.
              </p>

              <p>
                Modern writing applications often feel bloated, monetized, and detached
                from the human-centered foundation of writing. Subscription models and
                feature sprawl have shifted focus away from expression and clarity.
              </p>

              <p>
                Quillty challenges that trajectory by reframing writing software as an
                environment rather than a toolset—one that supports both professional
                and creative work without attempting to write for the user.
              </p>
            </section>

            <section id="role">
              <div class="section-heading">02 — Role & Constraints</div>
              <h2 class="section-title">Design Perspective</h2>

              <p>
                My role in Quillty extended beyond interface design. The project
                required thinking like a writer first, rather than approaching the
                problem from a feature-driven or corporate perspective.
              </p>

              <p>
                Writing is inherently bottom-up: anyone can begin with words on a page,
                but not every environment supports focus, structure, or sustained flow.
                Every design decision was evaluated against a single question:
              </p>

              <p><em>“Does this environment help the writer do what they already know how to do?”</em></p>

              <p>
                This version of Quillty is intentionally mid-fidelity. It explores
                structure, hierarchy, and interaction philosophy rather than final
                visual polish or full prototyping.
              </p>

            <section id="philosophy">
              <div class="section-heading">03 — Design Philosophy</div>
              <h2 class="section-title">Solving the Hard Problems First</h2>

              <p>
                Quillty represents a broader shift in my design process. Rather than
                refining surfaces first, I focus on identifying and resolving the most
                structurally difficult problems early.
              </p>

              <p>
                Once those foundational decisions are made, everything else—from user
                flows to interface layout—becomes clearer and more coherent.
              </p>

              <p>
                The interface draws lessons from tools like Microsoft Word, Google Drive,
                Adobe Reader, and Framer. Each influenced Quillty in different ways,
                from document structure to visual restraint.
              </p>

              <p>
                The result is an environment that remains quiet, collapsible, and
                focused—protecting the central writing space from unnecessary interruption.
              </p>

            <section id="navigation">
              <div class="section-heading">04 — Navigation Structure</div>
              <h2 class="section-title">Top-Level Organization</h2>

              <p>
                Quillty’s navigation bar establishes the application’s primary structure
                without competing for attention. It anchors document identity and
                workspace controls while remaining visually understated.
              </p>

              <p>
                Future iterations may expand its capabilities, but the guiding principle
                remains consistent: navigation should support writing, not interrupt it.
              </p>

            <section id="panels">
              <div class="section-heading">05 — Side Panels</div>
              <h2 class="section-title">Structure Without Distraction</h2>

              <p>
                Quillty is organized around two primary side panels: a Mapping Panel on the left
                and a Styles Panel on the right. Together, they provide structure and control
                while preserving focus.
              </p>

              <h3>Mapping Panel</h3>
              <p>
                The Mapping Panel organizes long-form documents into a clear hierarchy.
                It enables navigation between sections without breaking flow or context.
              </p>

              <h3>Styles Panel</h3>
              <p>
                The Styles Panel centralizes formatting and media tools in a minimal, scrollable environment.
                Its design avoids the clutter typical of traditional word processors.
              </p>

              <p>
                A key design decision involved separating content uploads into a dedicated collapsible
                area beneath the panel. This prevents constant scrolling and preserves the panel’s predictability.
              </p>

              <p>
                Editing controls balance keyboard-driven input and structured dropdowns,
                allowing power without visual noise.
              </p>
            </section>

            <section id="direction">
              <div class="section-heading">06 — Future Direction</div>
              <h2 class="section-title">Evolving the Environment</h2>

              <p>
                Quillty currently focuses on the core writing experience. Future exploration may expand
                into note-taking systems, enhanced writing support, synchronization, and lightweight file management.
              </p>

              <p>
                The guiding principle remains restraint. Features are only added when they genuinely support
                clarity and consistency rather than novelty.

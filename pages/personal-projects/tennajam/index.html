                TennaJam is a systems-focused product design project exploring how
                dedicated game-server hosting could feel calmer, clearer, and more
                trustworthy if it were designed around flow, structure, and long-term
                experience integrity rather than surface-level complexity.

              <h2 class="section-title">Why This Project Exists</h2>

              <p>
                Dedicated game-server hosting has existed for decades, yet the
                experience remains surprisingly fragile. Configuration workflows
                are dense, interfaces are intimidating, and small mistakes often
                feel irreversible.
              </p>

              <p>
                TennaJam began as a personal response to that gap. The project is
                grounded in one core question:
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>
                  What would server hosting feel like if it reduced uncertainty
                  instead of amplifying it?
                </strong>
              </p>

              <h2 class="section-title">Designing for Confidence</h2>

              <p>
                TennaJam is not about removing advanced control. It is about
                structuring power so it is understandable, predictable, and safe
                to use.
              </p>

              <ul class="clean">
                <li>Clear, repeatable flow structures</li>
                <li>Strong separation between overview and detail</li>

                <li>Consistent language for states and actions</li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                The goal is a hosting environment that feels stable and calm, even
                when the underlying system is complex.

              <p>
                TennaJam is a personal product project where my role is to ensure
                that the system behaves as intended from an experience and
                structural standpoint.
              </p>

              <p class="muted">
                Business modeling, pricing strategy, and infrastructure

              <p>
                TennaJam is intentionally organized around a small number of

              <p>
                This project reinforced a core belief: complex systems do not need
                to feel complex. When structure, language, and flow align with how
                people think, even infrastructure-heavy tools can feel approachable
                and safe.

              <p>
                TennaJam is an ongoing systems-design exploration. The work is
                intentionally early and conceptual, focused on correctness,
                clarity, and long-term coherence rather than execution.

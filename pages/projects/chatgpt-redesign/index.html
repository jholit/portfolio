              A structural redesign that separates conversation and navigation to reduce cognitive friction and create a calmer, more focused communication experience.

            <div class="section-heading">01 — Problem</div>

            <p>
              ChatGPT's interface mixed conversation, navigation, and system controls into the same visual functional space.
            </p>

            <p>
              The main conversation area - the products core feature - was frequently interrupted by navigation elements, projects folders, and structural controls. 
              These elements behaved more like a file system than a communication interface.
            </p>

            <p>
              As a result, users had to divide their attention between talking and managing the system. Simple actions like switching conversations or locating previous 
              chats required unnecessary effort and broke conversation flow. 
            </p>

            <p>
              The interface was structurally logical from a system standpoint, but it did not align with how users naturally think about conversations.
            </p>
          </section>

          <!-- ========================= -->
          <!--       02 — WHY            -->
          <!-- ========================= -->

          <section id="goals">
            <div class="section-heading">02 — Why It Mattered</div>

            <p>
              ChatGPT is fundamentally a conversation-driven product. The conversation area is the primary workspace.
            </p>

            <p>
              When users must think about where conversations are stored, organized, or accessed, the interface introduced cognitive overhead that distracts from the its main task: communicating.
            </p>
            <p>
              This creates three usability problems:
            </p>

            <ul class="clean">
              <li>Reduced focus due to competing interface elements</li>
              <li>Slower task flow when switching or managing conversations</li>
              <li>Increased cognitive load from system-oriented structure</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              Over time, this makes the product feel more complex and less intuitive, even when functionality is technically correct. 
            </p>

            <p>
              For a tool designed to assist thinking, any friction in conversation management directly undermines its effectiveness.
            </p>
          </section>

          <!-- ========================= -->
          <!--      03 — DECISION       -->
          <!-- ========================= -->

          <section id="variants">
            <div class="section-heading">03 — Decision</div>

            <p>
              I organized the interfaced based on human mental models rather than system structure. 
            </p>

            <p>
              The main conversation area was preserved as a dedicated, uninterrupted space exclusively preserved for communication.
            </p>

            <p>
              All navigation, conversation management, and organization controls were consolidated into the left-panel. This established a single, consistent location for all navigation actions.
            </p>

            <p>
              This separation created clear functional boundaries:
            </p>

            <ul class="clean">
              <li>Left panel: navigation and conversation management</li>
              <li>Center panel: conversation only</li>
            </ul>
          </section>

          <p>This decision reinforced spatial consistency and reduced the need for users to shift content while interacting with the product.</p>

          <!-- ============================= -->
          <!--   04 — REASONS FOR APPROACH   -->
          <!-- ============================= -->

          <section id="decisions">
            <div class="section-heading">04 — Why This Approach Worked</div>

            <p>
              This structure aligns with established user expectations across modern applications, where navigation exists independently from the primary workspace.
            </p>

            <p>
              By assigning each area a single responsibility, the interface becomes:
            </p>

            <ul class="clean">
              <li>Easier to learn</li>
              <li>Easier to predict</li>
              <li>Easier to use</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              Users no longer need to interpret or manage system structure while conversing.
            </p>

            <p>
              The interface supports the users goal instead of exposing the systems internal organization.
            </p>
          </section>

          <!-- ========================= -->
          <!--      05 — OUTCOME         -->
          <!-- ========================= -->

          <section id="outcome">
            <div class="section-heading">05 — Outcome</div>

            <p>
              The redesigned layout improved usability by reducing cognitive friction and clarifying interface roles.
            </p>

            <p>
              Users can now:
            </p>

            <ul class="clean">
              <li>Switch conversations quickly without disrupting their workflow</li>
              <li>Maintain focus on the active conversation</li>
              <li>Understand where navigation and controls are located without searching</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              The interface feels calmer, more intentional, and easier to operate because each section serves a clear and consistent purpose.
            </p>

            <p>
              This change improves usability immediate while also providing scalable foundation for future features.

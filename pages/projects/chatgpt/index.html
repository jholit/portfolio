          <!-- 01 — PROBLEM -->
          <section id="problem">
            <h2 class="section-heading">01 — Problem</h2>

            <p>
              ChatGPT's interface mixed conversation, navigation, and system controls into the same visual space.
            </p>

            <p>
              The main conversation area — the product’s core feature — was frequently interrupted by navigation elements, project folders, and structural controls.
              These elements behaved more like a file system than a communication interface.
            </p>

            <p>
              As a result, users had to divide their attention between talking and managing the system. Simple actions like switching conversations or locating previous chats required unnecessary effort and broke conversation flow.
            </p>

            <p>
              The interface was structurally logical from a system standpoint, but it did not align with how users naturally think about conversations.
            </p>
          </section>

          <!-- 02 — WHY -->
          <section id="impact">
            <h2 class="section-heading">02 — Why It Mattered</h2>

            <p>
              ChatGPT is fundamentally a conversation-driven product. The conversation area is the primary workspace.
            </p>

            <p>
              When users must think about where conversations are stored, organized, or accessed, the interface introduces cognitive overhead that distracts from its main task: communicating.
            </p>

            <p>This creates three usability problems:</p>

            <ul class="clean">
              <li>Reduced focus due to competing interface elements</li>
              <li>Slower task flow when switching or managing conversations</li>
              <li>Increased cognitive load from system-oriented structure</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              Over time, this makes the product feel more complex and less intuitive, even when functionality is technically correct.
            </p>

            <p>
              For a tool designed to assist thinking, any friction in conversation management directly undermines its effectiveness.
            </p>
          </section>

          <!-- 03 — APPROACH -->
          <section id="approach">
            <h2 class="section-heading">03 — Decision</h2>

            <p>
              The interface was organized based on human mental models rather than system structure.
            </p>

            <p>
              The main conversation area was preserved as a dedicated, uninterrupted space exclusively reserved for communication.
            </p>

            <p>
              All navigation, conversation management, and organization controls were consolidated into the left panel, establishing a single, consistent location for navigation actions.
            </p>

            <p>This separation created clear functional boundaries:</p>

            <ul class="clean">
              <li>Left panel — navigation and conversation management</li>
              <li>Center panel — conversation only</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              This decision reinforced spatial consistency and reduced the need for users to shift content while interacting with the product.
            </p>
          </section>

          <!-- 04 — WHY IT WORKED -->
          <section id="validation">
            <h2 class="section-heading">04 — Why This Approach Worked</h2>

            <p>
              This structure aligns with established user expectations across modern applications, where navigation exists independently from the primary workspace.
            </p>

            <p>
              By assigning each area a single responsibility, the interface becomes:
            </p>

            <ul class="clean">
              <li>Easier to learn</li>
              <li>Easier to predict</li>
              <li>Easier to use</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              Users no longer need to interpret or manage system structure while conversing.
            </p>

            <p>
              The interface supports the user’s goal instead of exposing the system’s internal organization.
            </p>
          </section>

          <!-- 05 — OUTCOME -->
          <section id="outcome">
            <h2 class="section-heading">05 — Outcome</h2>

            <p>
              The redesigned layout improved usability by reducing cognitive friction and clarifying interface roles.
            </p>

            <p>Users can now:</p>

            <ul class="clean">
              <li>Switch conversations quickly without disrupting workflow</li>
              <li>Maintain focus on the active conversation</li>
              <li>Understand where navigation and controls are located without searching</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              The interface feels calmer, more intentional, and easier to operate because each section serves a clear and consistent purpose.
            </p>

            <p>
              This change improves usability immediately while also providing a scalable foundation for future features.
